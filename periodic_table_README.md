# freeCodeCamp: Relational Database Certificate Project \#4
## Build a Periodic Table Database
This is one of the required projects to earn certification. For this project, a Bash script was built to get information about chemical elements from a periodic table database. The database and script can be found in the files: `periodic_table.sql` and `element.sh`.
