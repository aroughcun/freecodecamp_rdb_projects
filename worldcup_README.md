# freeCodeCamp: Relational Database Certificate Project \#2
## Build a World Cup Database
This is one of the required projects to earn certification. For this project, a bash script that enters information from the World Cup games into PostgreSQL was built and queried for useful statistics. The database can be found in the `worldcup.sql` file. The bash script for entering information in the database and querying the database can be found in the `insert_data.sh` file and `queries.sh` file, respectively.
