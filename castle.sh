# Created with nano, which allows file editing within the terminal

# ^ character in front of command --> <CTRL>
# M character in front of command --> "Meta" - a key that doesn't exist on most keyboards, therefore if on OSX use <escape>, for all others use <ALT>

# to open file: nano <filename>
# to save file: <CTRL> + o (gives option to edit/rename file, otherwise <ENTER> to save)
# to exit nano: <CTRL> + x

# <CTRL> + k: cut entire line
# <CTRL> + u: uncut entire line (can be used repeatedly in a "copy & paste" fashion)
