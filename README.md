# freeCodeCamp: Relational Database Certificate Project \#1
## Build a Celestial Bodies Database
This is one of the required projects to earn certification. For this project, a database of celestial bodies will be built using PostgreSQL.

## Instructions
### Step 1: Complete the project
> The project runs in a virtual machine, complete the user stories described in there and get all the tests to pass to finish step 1.

Important: After you pass all the project tests, save a dump of your database into a `universe.sql` file so you can complete step 2. There will be instructions how to do that within the virtual machine.

### Step 2: Submit your code
> When you have completed the project, save all the required files into a public repository and submit the URL to it below.

Required files: `universe.sql`
